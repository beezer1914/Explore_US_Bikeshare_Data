Using python, we analyzed bikeshare data across the United States. I created an interactive environment where users could choose the data they wished to analyze.

Modules used in this project: 

NumPy: NumPy stands for Numerical Python and it's a fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. NumPy provides Python with an extensive math library capable of performing numerical computations effectively and efficiently. 

Pandas: Pandas is a package for data manipulation and analysis in Python. The name Pandas is derived from the econometrics term Panel Data. Pandas incorporates two additional data structures into Python, namely Pandas Series and Pandas DataFrame. These data structures allow us to work with labeled and relational data in an easy and intuitive manner.
